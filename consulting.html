<h3>The Coca-Cola Company</h3>
<p>I partnered with Coca-Cola North America Supply Chain on a series of large-scale HR and organizational effectiveness projects spanning more than 20 plants nationwide. My work included designing and implementing a rewards and recognition program, validating and deploying employee selection tests, and converting assessments to online formats. I also led initiatives to enhance performance management and compensation systems, producing a “Manufacturing Aspiration Roadmap” that established standardized metrics and supported a company-wide success share program. Additional contributions included developing training facilitation manuals, reviewing quality procedures, creating SAP readiness presentations, mapping HR and operational processes, and advising on apprenticeship programs. Many of these efforts resulted in enterprise-wide adoption of new systems and practices, improving consistency, engagement, and decision-making across the supply chain.</p>

<h4>Human Resources Research Organization</h3>
<p>I collaborated with HumRRO on a wide range of applied research and assessment projects for government and professional organizations. My work supported the Air Force, Army, ATF, U.S. Marshals Service, Census Bureau, and professional groups such as the American Society for Training and Development. Projects included developing and evaluating selection systems, structured interviews, and certification exams; conducting large-scale job analyses; cleaning and analyzing complex datasets; and assessing the validity and fairness of assessments such as TAPAS, language proficiency measures, and assessment center exercises. I also contributed to leadership competency modeling for Army brigades, quality assurance for NAEP testing, and communication strategy reviews for HumRRO itself. These efforts involved data entry and analysis, psychometric evaluation, literature reviews, training SMEs, and technical report writing, with results used to inform client decision-making, shape policies, and revise large-scale assessment and training programs.</p>

<h3>Perconnel Development and Hiring</h3>

For the Army, I examined the validity and reliability of the Global Assessment Tool (GAT) and related measures, producing peer-reviewed work that informed large-scale applications of the Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness program. For NASA, I contributed to a systematic review of mental health and performance in isolated, confined, and extreme environments, helping to identify well-being factors most critical for long-duration space missions. Together, these projects advanced the scientific understanding of resilience and performance in both military and spaceflight contexts.</p>
