</h3>
<p><em>Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Perspectives on Science and Practice</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This commentary examines the role of corrigenda and retractions as mechanisms of scientific self-correction. It argues that while mistakes are inevitable in research, transparent corrections are essential to maintaining trust in the field. The piece calls for a cultural shift that normalizes correction as part of robust science.

</h3>
<p><em>The Learning Organization</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This article introduces joint-variance synthesis as a new way to model exploration–exploitation relationships in organizational ambidexterity research. The approach reduces confounds and better captures the reciprocal dynamics theorized between exploration and exploitation. Findings provide stronger empirical alignment with theory and new insights for organizational performance.

</h3>
<p><em>Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Perspectives on Science and Practice</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This commentary argues that publishing in high-prestige journals does not guarantee research quality. It highlights how pressures to publish in “top” outlets may incentivize questionable research practices and undermine rigor. The piece urges scholars and institutions to rethink how quality and impact are assessed in academia.

</h3>
<p><em>Military Psychology</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This study investigates how transformational leadership and psychological capital influence stress and well-being in combat environments. Findings show that leadership’s buffering effects on stress grow stronger as risk levels increase, with psychological resources providing additional resilience. The work expands leadership theory by examining boundary conditions in extreme contexts.

</h3>
<p><em>Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Perspectives on Science and Practice</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This commentary explores the emerging concept of antiwork from two perspectives: as a philosophical critique of work and as a measurable attitude or construct. It argues that recognizing antiwork as an attitudinal dimension could generate new insights into workforce motivation and disengagement. The piece calls for research that operationalizes antiwork to expand organizational theory.
