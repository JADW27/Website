</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This article details the development and validation of a new conditional reasoning test designed to measure implicit risk-taking tendencies and propensity for workplace incidents. The test demonstrates predictive validity for safety behaviors and outcomes, outperforming traditional self-report measures. The work offers a promising tool for improving safety assessments by capturing implicit biases linked to risk and incident involvement.

</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This article applies item response theory to evaluate the Conditional Reasoning Test of Aggression. Findings show that the test functions as intended, with item characteristics aligning with underlying theory and providing the most information for individuals high in latent aggression. The study offers evidence that the CRT-A is a valid and effective indirect measure of aggressive tendencies.

</h3>
<p><em>Assessment</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This article introduces and validates a new measure of resilience that incorporates five protective factors: adaptability, emotion regulation, optimism, self-efficacy, and social support. Analyses demonstrate strong reliability, convergent validity with established resilience scales, and predictive links to well-being and healthy behaviors. The Five-by-Five Resilience Scale provides a multidimensional yet parsimonious tool for capturing resilience in diverse settings.

</h3>
<p><em>The SAGE Handbook of Survey Development and Application</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This book chapter provides a comprehensive overview of reliability in survey research. It explains different types of reliability estimates, their assumptions, and their implications for measurement precision and validity. The chapter emphasizes critical thinking in selecting and reporting reliability estimates, offering guidance to researchers on best practices for ensuring survey quality.

</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Organizational Behavior</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This article evaluates two competing versions of the Passion Scale used to measure harmonious and obsessive work passion. Results reveal that while both versions show acceptable reliability and validity, they differ in their ability to capture relationships between the two forms of passion and to assess extreme levels. The study provides methodological clarity and best practice recommendations for passion research in organizational contexts.

</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Personality Assessment</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This paper assesses the validity of the 24-item Abbreviated Character Strengths Test, an efficient measure derived from the VIA model. Results show limited structural validity, weak-to-moderate links with Big Five traits, and only partial support for expected relationships with well-being outcomes. The findings highlight the need for refinement before the ACST can serve as a reliable substitute for longer character strengths inventories.
