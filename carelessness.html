<h2>Research on Careless Responding: Publications and References</h2>
<!-- Repeat the following block for each publication -->
<div class="publication">
<h3 class="publication-title">
<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-26270-001" target="_blank">Stop With the Questions Already! Does Data Quality Suffer for Scales Positioned Near the End of a Lengthy Questionnaire?</a>
</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Business and Psychology</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This study investigates how the length of a survey scale influences the likelihood and impact of careless responding. Longer scales increase the risk of fatigue and careless answering, which in turn affect reliability and validity. The article offers guidance on balancing measurement precision with practical survey design.

</h3>
<p><em>SIOP White Paper Series</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This white paper synthesizes a decade of research on careless responding, summarizing key findings and offering practical recommendations. It highlights detection methods, substantive predictors, and the organizational consequences of ignoring low-quality data. The report serves as a resource for scholars and practitioners committed to data quality in organizational research.

</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Business and Psychology</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This paper examines the prevalence and consequences of careless responding in organizational surveys. Results indicate that even modest amounts of low-effort data bias relationships among key constructs and lead to misleading conclusions. The study emphasizes the need for routine screening and methodological vigilance in applied research.

<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/job.1962" target="_blank">Best Practice Recommendations for Data Screening</a>
</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Organizational Behavior</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This article outlines practical strategies for detecting and addressing careless responding in organizational research datasets. It shows how different data-cleaning techniques can substantially alter results, underscoring the importance of proactive screening. The work provides actionable recommendations for maintaining validity and credibility in analyses.

</h3>
<p><em>Applied Psychology: An International Review</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This simulation explores how different levels of careless responding influence statistical power and parameter estimates. The results show that even small proportions of insufficient effort responding distort findings, particularly in smaller samples. The study illustrates the risks associated with ignoring data quality issues.

</h3>
<p><em>Organizational Research Methods</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This article investigates the role of implicit aggression as a predictor of careless responding. Findings suggest that individuals higher in aggression are more likely to respond carelessly, offering a substantive explanation for why IER occurs. The study bridges methodological concerns and personality, demonstrating that carelessness is not just random noise.

</h3>
<p><em>Journal of Business and Psychology</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This research examines the effects of careless responding on test performance and score validity. Results show that careless answers can inflate or mask relationships between variables, threatening the integrity of assessment results. The article underscores the importance of monitoring effort in testing situations where high-stakes decisions are made.

</h3>
<p><em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></p>
<p class="publication-description">
        This study evaluates the effectiveness of response speed and consistency checks as indicators of careless responding. Findings demonstrate that combining these approaches identifies problematic data more effectively than using a single method. The article highlights simple, scalable tools for safeguarding data quality.
